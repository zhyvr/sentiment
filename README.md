## Kurdish Sentiment Analysis

# Introduction
The Kurdish Sentiment Analysis project aims to analyze the sentiment of text written in the Kurdish language. Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a piece of text, whether it is positive, negative, or neutral (soon). This project focuses specifically on the Kurdish language, which is spoken by millions of people primarily in the Kurdistan region spanning across Iraq, Iran, Turkey, and Syria.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a model that can accurately classify the sentiment of Kurdish text. This can be useful in various applications such as social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, political opinion tracking, and market research. By understanding the sentiment behind Kurdish text, businesses, organizations, and individuals can gain valuable insights into public opinion, customer satisfaction, and overall trends.
